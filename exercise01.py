Question 1
Given a list of tuples containing two numerical values, write a function that
returns a list of the same tuples, sorted by the absolute value of the
difference between the two numbers, in descending order.

For example, if the input is:

l = [
    (1, 2),
    (-4, -5.5),
    (10, -10),
    (-2, 2)
]
Then the return value of the function should be:

[
  (10, -10)
  (-2, 2),
  (-4, -5.5),
  (1, 2)
]
